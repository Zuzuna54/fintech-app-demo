# Frontend Data Fetching Standardization

## Current Data Fetching Patterns

1. **SWR Hooks**:

   - `useUsers` - Fetches user data with pagination and sorting
   - `useOrganizations` - Fetches organization data
   - Custom SWR implementations in various components

2. **Direct API Calls**:

   - Using `api` instance from `@/lib/api`
   - Mix of direct calls and SWR fetcher

3. **Authentication**:
   - Token-based auth with refresh mechanism
   - Auth state management through context

## Issues in Current Implementation

1. Inconsistent error handling
2. Mixed usage of direct API calls and SWR
3. Duplicate pagination/sorting logic
4. Inconsistent caching strategies
5. No standardized loading states

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Completed Steps

1. Created new branch `feature/data-fetching-standardization`
2. Created base hooks in `/hooks/api/` directory:
   - `useQuery.ts` - Type-safe query hook factory with SWR
   - `useMutation.ts` - Type-safe mutation hook factory
   - `index.ts` - Exports for the API hooks
3. Created comprehensive type definitions for API responses:
   - âœ… Base response types and error types
   - âœ… User response types
   - âœ… Organization response types
   - âœ… Account response types
   - âœ… Payment response types

### ðŸš§ Remaining Steps

1. Update components with new hooks:

   - [ ] Users page and related components
   - [ ] Organizations page and related components
   - [ ] Accounts page and related components
   - [ ] Payments page and related components

2. Add tests for new hooks:

   - [ ] Query hook tests
   - [ ] Mutation hook tests
   - [ ] Integration tests

3. Update documentation:

   - [ ] API hooks usage guide
   - [ ] Migration guide
   - [ ] Type definitions

4. Review and testing:
   - [ ] Code review
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Error handling testing
   - [ ] Edge cases testing

## Components Requiring Updates

1. `/app/(auth)/users/page.tsx`
2. `/app/(auth)/organizations/page.tsx`
3. `/app/(auth)/accounts/page.tsx`
4. `/app/(auth)/payments/page.tsx`
5. `/components/modals/UserModal/UserModal.tsx`
6. `/components/modals/OrganizationModal/OrganizationModal.tsx`
7. `/components/modals/AccountModal/AccountModal.tsx`
8. `/hooks/useUsers.ts`
9. `/hooks/useOrganizations.ts`
10. `/hooks/useAccounts.ts`
11. `/hooks/usePayments.ts`

## Migration Strategy

1. Implement new hooks alongside existing ones
2. Gradually migrate components to new system
3. Test thoroughly after each component migration
4. Remove old implementation once all components are migrated
5. Update tests and documentation

## Next Steps

1. Create type definitions for API responses
2. Start with Users page migration:
   - Update `useUsers` hook
   - Update Users page
   - Update UserModal
   - Test changes
3. Continue with Organizations page
4. Move on to Accounts and Payments
5. Final testing and documentation
